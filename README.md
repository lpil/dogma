## This tool has been deprecated

With the new [formatter](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/master/Mix.Tasks.Format.html)
in Elixir v1.6 I don't think there is a use for Dogma any more. Thanks for
using this linter, it's been fun :)

## Intro


Dogma is a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as
**incontrovertibly true**.

It's also a code style linter for Elixir, powered by shame.

## About

Dogma is a tool for enforcing a consistent Elixir code style within your
project, the idea being that if your code is easier to read, it should also be
easier to understand. It's highly configurable so you can adjust it to fit your
style guide, but comes with a sane set of defaults so for most people it
should just work out-of-the-box. I like to run Dogma on the CI server with
the test suite, and consider the build broken if Dogma reports a problem.

If you're interested in a tool more geared towards making style suggestions
rather than strictly enforcing your style guide, check out
[Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo).


## Usage

Add Dogma to your Mix dependencies

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:dogma, "~> 0.1", only: :dev},
  ]
end
```

Fetch it:

```
mix deps.get
```

Run the mix task:

```
mix dogma
```

You'll get something like this:

```
Inspecting 27 files.

.....X..........X..........

27 files, 2 errors!

== lib/dogma/rules.ex ==
23: TrailingBlankLines: Blank lines detected at end of file

== test/dogma/formatter_test.exs ==
9: TrailingWhitespace: Trailing whitespace detected
```

How handy!

### Ignoring a rule

Sometimes, you may want to ignore a rule on a specific line.
This can be accomplished like so:

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def bar do
    "baz"; # dogma:ignore Semicolon
  end
end
```

### Install Dogma globally

In order to run dogma from any directory build the escript:
```
mix escript.build
```

this will create an executable that you can place in your PATH
and invoke from anywhere.


## Contributor Information

### Test it

```sh
mix test       # Run tests once
mix test.watch # Run tests on file changes
mix dogma      # Dogfooding- run the linter!
```
