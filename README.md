Dogma is a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as
**incontrovertibly true**.

It's also a code style linter for Elixir, powered by shame.

<br/>

## Usage

We've got a mix task!

```
mix dogma
```

Run it, and you'll get something like this:

```
Inspecting 27 files.

.....X..........X..........

27 files, 2 errors!

== lib/dogma/rules.ex ==
23: TrailingBlankLines: Blank lines detected at end of file

== test/dogma/formatter_test.exs ==
9: TrailingWhitespace: Trailing whitespace detected [33]
```

How handy!
